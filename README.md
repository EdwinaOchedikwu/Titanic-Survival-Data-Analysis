# Titanic-Survival-Data-Analysis
Analysis of titanic survival data, using histograms, scatter plots and tree maps
Project 1: Titanic Passenger Survival Analysis with Bar Charts
Title: Visualizing Survival Rates on the Titanic Using Bar Charts

Summary:

Techniques Used:
Bar charts to compare survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and embarkation points.
Data aggregation and pivot tables to summarize survival data.
Visualization techniques to highlight key differences and trends in survival rates.
Details:
Utilized a dataset containing details of Titanic passengers.
Created bar charts to visualize the count of survivors versus those who perished, segmented by class, gender, and embarkation point.
Demonstrated differences in survival rates, showing how first-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to other classes, and how women had higher survival rates than men.

Project 2: Exploring Relationships on the Titanic Using Scatter Plots
Title: Analyzing Passenger Attributes and Survival on the Titanic with Scatter Plots

Summary:

Techniques Used:
Scatter plots to examine relationships between variables such as age, fare, and survival status.
Data transformation to add jitter to family size for better visualization.
Exploratory data analysis to identify correlations and patterns.
Details:
Analyzed the Titanic dataset focusing on age, fare, and family size of passengers.
Created scatter plots to explore the relationship between fare paid and age, and how these factors influenced survival.
Used jittered family size to prevent overplotting and provide clearer insights into the distribution and trends.

Project 3: Visualizing Categorical Data with Treemap Charts
Title: Utilizing Treemap Charts to Display Titanic Passenger Data

Summary:

Techniques Used:
Treemap charts for visualizing hierarchical data.
Data segmentation by categories such as passenger class, gender, and survival status.
Color coding to distinguish between different groups within the data.
Details:
Employed treemap charts to provide a comprehensive overview of the Titanic passenger data.
Visualized how different segments such as class and gender contributed to overall survival statistics.
Illustrated the proportion of survivors and those who perished within each category, providing a clear, hierarchical view of the data.
